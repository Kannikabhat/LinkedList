Chunk_0_1:
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. It defines the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on them. Data structures are essential for managing and processing large amounts of data effectively.

Chunk_0_2:
Data structures can be classified into two main categories: primitive and non-primitive. Primitive data structures include basic types such as integers, floats, and characters. Non-primitive data structures are more complex and include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

Chunk_0_3:
The choice of data structure affects the efficiency of algorithms. For example, searching for an item in a list may be slower than searching in a hash table. Choosing the right data structure can reduce time and space complexity significantly.

Chunk_0_4:
Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are theoretical models that define data and the operations on them without specifying implementation details. Examples of ADTs include List, Stack, Queue, and Graph. ADTs help separate the logical view of data from its physical representation.

Chunk_0_5:
Applications of data structures can be found everywhere: operating systems use queues and trees; search engines use graphs and hash maps; social media platforms use graphs to model connections; and compilers use stacks and symbol tables. Understanding data structures is fundamental to becoming a good programmer.
